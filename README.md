# NashvilleHousingProject

This project was an EDA on Nashville Housing Data. 

First I used multiple SQL scripts to clean, aggregate and wrangle data

Then used extracted data to create exploratory interactive Tableau Dashboard

Then used predictive models 
- Linear Regression Model
- Decision Tree Regressor Model
- Random Forest Regressor Model
To predict the value of a home based on different input factors.

I then obtained MSE and R^2 values and used matplotlib and numpy to visualize differences between model accuracy
